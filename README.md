# When viewing the queries.sql file, please feel free to either run the code individually from the SELECT commands, to the semi-colon, or run the code to show the view corresponding to the questions.

# Upon reviewing the data, while the frequency of salaries skews right as we would expect, the Average Salary by title graph shows a much different story.

Also, pulling the ID number on my badge(499942), the database tells me that my name is: "April Foolsday"
